This is where I put my programs and code
---

blink.py

   This is a python script to have an LED blink on the breadboard.

decider.sh

    This is a decider, due to my indecisiveness it will help me choose what to do.

    It looks at my file of things to do and using a random number generator and awk it will pick something for me to do.
    
decider.txt
    
    Test file for decider.sh.
